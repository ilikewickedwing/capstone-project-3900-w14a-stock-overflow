Week 1
The group was formed, and we chose the stock portfolio management system project. The Jira group was formed, and roles distributed. 
I was given the role of working on the back end, and together we decided that the project would be hosted online, and that we would use
Express.js and React to build the system. Each member was tasked with coming up with 8 functionalities that fit the requirements of the 
project proposal.

Week 2
The core functionalities were chosen, and some novelties were also decided. I was assigned to work on user stories and accpetance criteria.

Week 3
We finished the project proposal, assigned tasks to sprints and to members as well. We then started working on sprint 1.
