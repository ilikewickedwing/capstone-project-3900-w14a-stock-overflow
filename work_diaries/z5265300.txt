Week 1
Group formed. Group voted and decided on implementing project 4 - stock portfolio management. Discussed ways of implementing said project such as which software to use and what platform we would decide on.
I was assigned as scrum master and jira page was created. We each individually came up with our own set of requirements to discuss on a consensus of what functionalty to implement for our next scrum meeting.
We will delegate sections of the proposal and discuss further implementations for the next session that we attend.

Week 2
Group discussed the functionality of our stock app. We delegated sections for each member to draft in preparation for our next tutorial (since its the last
tutorial before proprosal submission date). Created the repo for github. 
Non-technical obstacles: team does not have a lot of knowledge on stocks in general; need to do more research on this part.
Pending application name and finalisation of user stories to put in jira scrums. Draft of the proposal to be completed by the end of this week.
Plans for next week: starting the first sprint.

Week 3
We started our weekly meetings with standups, to discuss the progress of our proposal. We finished our proposal on the sunday.
For my part, I completed the storyboards and user flow part of the proposal. 
However, we faced difficulties brainstorming ideas to make the novel features more advanced. 

Week 4
Implemented a navigation bar to be used on all pages of the website.
To be implemented: tabbing / non-tabbing of the different portfolios.
Challenge: finding a way to implement the graph of our page. Struggle to concurrently connect front and backend together. 

Week 5
- Tabbing of portfolios done
- Presented our milestone this week
- implemented the connection between front and backen
- todo: fix bugs in loading stuff and names popping out of nowhere

Week 6
- refactored frontend code 
- fixed refreshing bug with the tabs and rename not changing (from week 5) 
- todo: finish sprint 1 before mid week 7 so we can start on sprint 2 


Week 7
- refactored more frontend code/ fixed bug issues with the delete portfolio function
- implemented code for the search bar of the page (located in Navigation.jsx)
- met up on the 31st Oct Sunday (all attended) to discuss progress

Week 8
- TODO: complete milestone 2 before starting 3. Alternatively, implement the frontend for 3 first then go back to continue 2.

- done: 
  - refactored Mison's part from milestone 2, reformatted some page layouts
  - fixed visibility on component change (AddStock)
  - fixed the search bar to livesearch ( challenge: laggy cos the list is really big)

Week 9 
- during standup at the beginning of the week, we delegated work for the report. (Mison absent).
- Mison also informed the team and I that he cannot do his assigned part from sprint 3. 
- put every api call into try/catch wrapper
- DONE:
  - US 2.4: multistocks ported on the page
  - all the stub and placeholders for US 5.1
- TODO:
  - final report, commenting code, encapsulating code
