    info: `I want to be a celebrity as a social animal, it is vital that we are accepted by our group, otherwise we will not survive. That's why it's so awfully painful to feel social rejection; it's to signal that there is something we have to fix immediately. On the other hand, it feels incredibly nice to be acknowledged and approved by our fellow humans, especially by those we ourselves admire and respect.`,

  {
    info: `I will make a great celebrity as such, in social groups there are also social hierarchies; the higher in the social hierarchy you find yourself, the less likely you are to be rejected, and thus the more likely you are to survive. In this age, celebrities epitomizes social status - they are at the absolutely top of the social ladder (some higher than others). If you are a well respected celebrity, let's say Ryan Gosling, then when you walk into a room, you automatically have social approval from every single person in the room. You are almost godlike in this social hierarchy compared to us 'normal' human beings.`,

    info: `Ever since childhood - I wanted to be a celebrity - On this primal level of understanding, then the idea of becoming a respected celebrity is basically like hitting the evolutionary jackpot. You don't even have to do anything, people will laugh at your bad jokes, people will find you attractive before you have uttered a word even if you are not handsome. People will want to be around you - your approval will seem like a touch from heaven to 'normal' people.`,

  {
    info: `Celebrity's are cool. Now we can intellectualize this all we want (and we should) and arguably some people will feel this temptation stronger than others, but that it is a very primal feeling is hard to deny. Obviously, there is no evolutionary jackpot to gain here; but how would you know if you haven't tried it yourself?`,

    info: `I suppose it has to do with the desire to stand out amongst 7 billion
    people. Before, people got noted for things they did, but how many
    people know even what some of the artists, poets, scientists, statesmen,
    and philospher of the last hundred years did?
    The media just drives this urge. You don't have to do much, if anything.
    Look at the Kardashians, Paris Hilton.
    Forget about hard work and using your brain and talents.
    As far as I am concerned, movie stars don't even have to know
    how to act very much, as they are prompted all the time and
    get plenty of retakes (as opposed to stage actors who live
    their character and must remember hundreds of lines).
    Do we really need ten thousand bands and singers?
    It is also the incentive of money and sex that drives some
    of these people.`,

    info: `At any age, there is always someone who you wanted to be, who inspires you daily.
    It could be a freedom fighter, a scientist, a lawyer, a doctor anything at all. Even during childhood, we play with toys related to a profession, a famous person, a imaginary character, a princess etc. these are all implanted into our brains in the childhood itself.`,

  {
    info: `Everyone likes to be famous for one reason or the other and that is what attracts. Lavish living, money are the other reasons. In the current age, media coverage is very high on celebrities. Celebrity news sells like hot cake for them. Sometimes they create rumors around celebrities to gain popularity.
    These days you can find and follow celebrities on social media. Earlier there is no way to contact them, to look into their lives etc.`,
